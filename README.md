Project Status:
Our project is currently in the development phase. We have many exciting features in the pipeline, including the elimination of the host role. Our goal is to have the application automatically track team answers. We also plan to implement a timer that allows the opposing team to steal if the timer runs out. Stay tuned for further updates!
